Startups like Cursor, Vercel, and Factory have already made GPT-5 the default model in certain key products and tools due to its faster setup, better results on complex tasks, and lower price. OpenAI has built out an enterprise sales team with more than 500 people. Enterprise demand is rising sharply, especially for planning and multi-step reasoning tasks..Every Apple Secret That Leaked Yesterday (1 minute read).Apple accidentally included hardware identifiers in software code linking to numerous unannounced products in a major slip on Wednesday. The information provided concrete evidence that Apple is currently developing a new HomePod mini with an S-series processor, a new Apple TV with an A17 chip, the Apple Studio Display 2, a new iPad mini with an A19 Pro chip, a new low-cost iPad with an A18 chip, an Apple Vision Pro with an M5 chip, and a new Apple Watch chip. Apple is also currently developing a Ring-like security camera, an iPad-style smart home hub, and a tabletop robot companion with a movable display..üöÄ.Science & Futuristic Technology.NASA has sparked a race to develop the data pipeline to Mars (3 minute read).NASA's relay spacecraft are still healthy, but they were never meant to be permanent. The agency's Space Communications and Navigation program is looking for solutions to augment these aging assets. It aims to create an interoperable marketplace where NASA can be one of many customers instead of the owner-operator. The program has requested capability studies for a 'lunar trunkline' between the Moon and Earth and end-to-end Mars communications that move data from assets on the surface, through Mars orbit, and to operations centers on Earth..AI designs antibiotics for gonorrhoea and MRSA superbugs (5 minute read).A team at MIT has used generative AI to design antibiotics that could kill drug-resistant gonorrhea and MRSA. The leading designs were tested on bacteria in the lab and on infected mice. They still need to go through a process of refinement before human studies can begin. The work demonstrates a novel approach with enormous potential for identifying new antibiotics. While AI promises to dramatically improve drug discovery and development, safety and efficacy testing processes are still required..üíª.Programming, Design & Data Science.How ThreatSpike added up to $75K in pipeline per campaign with TLDR Newsletter ads (Sponsor).ThreatSpike ditched underperforming channels like Google and LinkedIn for TLDR. The results?.    Consistent $25K to $75K in pipeline per campaign.    High-intent leads from enterprise companies with 30K+ employees.    Direct reach to decision-makers actively looking for solutions.We break down ThreatSpike's exact strategy, share their results, and reveal the ads that drove performance..Read the ThreatSpike case study..Back to being FOSS, Redis delivers a new, faster version (3 minute read).Redis 8.2 is now generally available - the previous FOSS release, version 7.2, will reach its scheduled end-of-life date at the end of February. It introduces over 14 new performance and efficiency improvements. Organizations still using Redis 7.2 will need to either move to Valkey or upgrade to a new major version of Redis. Redis 7.8 will endure until May 2027, but it isn't strictly FOSS..5 Useful CSS functions using the new @function rule (10 minute read).CSS functions just landed in Chrome 139. The capability helps developers write more organized and dynamic CSS. CSS functions can run logic - they accept arguments and return new values. Using custom functions makes code much neater. This article looks at some real-world examples of where CSS functions can come in handy. While Chrome is currently the only browser to have shipped the feature, CSS functions has gone through the CSSWG draft process, so other browsers should be implementing it soon..üéÅ.Miscellaneous.New trend: extreme hours at AI startups (11 minute read).Extreme working hours have long been rejected in the US because excessive hours tend to lead to burnout and other health issues in the long term. Despite that, more AI startups are increasing their hours, with some firms expecting staff to work more than 80 hours per week. These extreme hours are justified by a sprint to achieve Artificial General Intelligence in just a matter of months. These working hours will likely stay - the fear of missing out is very strong across the industry..Facebook is Dead; Long Live Meta (21 minute read).The days when Meta's self-identification as a social network caused them to miss fundamental shifts in the Internet are over. Meta used to talk about connection, but it has now switched to talking about empowering the individual. Facebook has transformed from a platform that connects people into a diverse global provider of entertaining and informative content. Being a social network was ultimately unsustainable, and Meta is now stronger than ever.
